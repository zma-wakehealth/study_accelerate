# Purpose
This document explains how to submit Accelerate and other general jobs on the Demon cluster, which uses SLURM for job scheduling.

# Most Important Lessons
- **`srun`** will execute the script `ntasks` times.
- For Accelerate, I need to run the `accelerate launch` on each node exactly once. Using `ntasks-per-node=1` solves this issue.

# Experiments

1. **Experiment 1**: Request 3 nodes on `defq`:
    - **Output**: `output_exp1.txt`
    - SLURM flags used: `--gpus=3`, `--partition=defq`
    
2. **Experiment 2**: Request 2 GPUs on the GPU partition, but on a single node (`demon120`):
    - **Output**: `output_exp2.txt`
    - SLURM flags used: `--gpus=2`, `--partition=gpu`, `--nodelist=demon120`

3. **Experiment 3**: Request 2 GPUs on the GPU partition, but on a single node (`demon121`):
    - **Output**: `output_exp3.txt`
    - SLURM flags used: `--gpus=2`, `--partition=gpu`, `--nodelist=demon121`

4. **Experiment 4**: Request 2 GPUs on the GPU partition, but spread across 2 nodes:
    - **Output**: `output_exp4.txt`
    - SLURM flags used: `--gpus=2`, `--partition=gpu`, `--nodes=2`, `--gpus-per-node=1`

### Overwriting Another User's GPU?

While working on the GPU partition, it is essential to assume that other jobs might be running on GPUs. To simulate this, I start an interactive sessions on both `demon120` and `demon121` nodes. Then, I submit jobs using `sbatch` from another terminal, SSH into the nodes, and use `nvidia-smi` to check GPU usage. This helps ensure that my batch jobs are not running on GPUs already occupied by interactive jobs.

Itâ€™s worth noting that, even though the GPU IDs provided by `$SLURM_STEP_GPUS` are correct, the actual output tensor GPU IDs are numbered from 0 upwards. For example, in the screenshot below, we observe:
- Someone else is using the actual GPU 0.
- My batch job is using GPUs 2 and 3.
- GPU 1 is idle.

(see also output_exp4_echo.txt for another example using 2 nodes, which shows the `$SLURM_STEP_GPUS` are the actual GPU IDs)

This suggests that either `torch.dist` or `Accelerate` automatically maps the GPU IDs, so users do not need to manually handle GPU ID assignments.
